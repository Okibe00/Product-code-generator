# User Story: Product Code System for Pharmaceutical Products

**Title:** Generate and Manage Product Codes for Pharmaceutical Items

**As a** pharmacy staff member or administrator,  
**I want to** generate unique and standardized product codes for pharmaceutical products,  
**so that** I can efficiently track, manage, and identify each product within the inventory system.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. **Code Generation:**
   - The system should automatically generate a unique code for each product.
   - Codes should follow a specific format (e.g., a combination of letters and numbers that represent product type, manufacturer, and a unique identifier).
   - The code generation should prevent duplicates.

2. **Product Information Association:**
   - Each generated code should be associated with detailed product information (name, manufacturer, expiry date, etc.).
   - The system should allow users to input and store this information.

3. **Search and Retrieval:**
   - Users should be able to search for products using the generated codes.
   - The search function should be quick and display relevant product details.

4. **Editing and Updating:**
   - Users should have the ability to update product information if necessary, with changes being reflected in the associated code.
   - The system should log changes to maintain a history of updates.

5. **Security and Access Control:**
   - Only authorized personnel should be able to generate or edit product codes.
   - Different user roles should have different levels of access to the system (e.g., admin, pharmacy staff).

6. **Audit Trail:**
   - The system should keep a log of all actions performed, including code generation, updates, and deletions, for audit purposes.

7. **User Interface:**
   - The interface should be user-friendly, allowing easy navigation and use.
   - A dashboard should display recently generated codes and allow quick access to code management features.

8. **Error Handling:**
   - The system should handle errors gracefully, providing informative error messages (e.g., when a duplicate code is attempted).

**Dependencies:**
- The system will require integration with the existing inventory management system.
- Access to a database where product information can be stored and retrieved.
